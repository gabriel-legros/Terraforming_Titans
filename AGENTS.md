# Instructions
- Document major feature updates in this file.
- Keep imports and exports browser friendly for loading via **index.html**.
- The game needs to be able to run from a browser-like environment.
- Place story projects in **progress-data.js** near the chapter where they unlock.
- Tooltips should use a `<span class="info-tooltip-icon">&#9432;</span>` element with a descriptive `title`.
- Keep checks of the kind (typeof something === 'function') and if(resources && resources.special && resources.special.spaceships) to a minimum.  If the checks fail, the code fails and it is better to catch it than let it fail.
- All UI elements should be cached and reused instead of using querySelector.

# Overview of code
This repository contains a browser-based incremental game written in JavaScript. The
entry point **index.html** loads scripts that create resources, buildings, colonies,
projects and research items from parameter files. Weather and surface modelling are
driven by modules like **terraforming.js**, **physics.js** and the various cycle files.
Economy and colony management rely on **resource.js**, **building.js**, **colony.js** and
UI modules. Story progression is handled by **StoryManager** in **progress.js** while
**SpaceManager** tracks the current planet.

# Additional gameplay systems
- **skills.js** and **skillsUI.js** implement the H.O.P.E. skill tree.
- **life.js** and **lifeUI.js** allow custom lifeform design.
- **space.js** and **spaceUI.js** manage interplanetary travel.
- **gold-asteroid.js** spawns a temporary bonus event.
- **autobuild.js** automatically constructs buildings when enabled.
- **milestones.js** and **milestonesUI.js** track long term goals.
- **solis.js** and **solisUI.js** provide a shop and quest system.
- The ResearchManager persists between planets so only advanced research remains after travel.

## Prestige systems
Two reset layers control long term progression:

### New game
Calling `startNewGame()` fully recreates the game state and returns the player to Mars. Nothing carries over between playthroughs.  Care must be taken to ensure that if any value is set later in the game, it must be reset or set again properly when starting a new game.

### Planet travel
Selecting another world via `selectPlanet(key)` soft resets the colony while keeping meta systems. It awards one skill point on the first visit and calls `initializeGameState({ preserveManagers: true, preserveJournal: true })` so that:
* `ResearchManager` survives but `resetRegularResearch()` clears normal tech while advanced research and its resource are preserved.
* `SkillManager` retains unlocked skills and re‑applies their effects.  Gained when travelling.
* `SolisManager` keeps quests, points and shop upgrades.  Can also buy artifact and provides an upgrade for permanent researches.
* `SpaceManager` records which planets have been visited or terraformed.
* `StoryManager` continues tracking active events and re‑applies their rewards.
* The **Dyson Swarm Receiver** project's collector count persists across planets, but the receiver must be rebuilt to regain energy production.

When loading a save or switching planets, call each manager's `reapplyEffects` method so stored modifiers affect the newly created game objects.

## Dyson Swarm Receiver
Research unlocks a large orbital array followed by the **Dyson Swarm Receiver** mega
project. The receiver costs 10&nbsp;M metal, 1&nbsp;M components and 100&nbsp;k electronics and
builds over five minutes. Once complete, players may deploy orbital solar collectors.
Collectors consume glass, electronics and components and can be automated. Their total
count persists between planets and each adds **Dyson Swarm** energy production.

Other modules include **save.js**, **projects.js**, **projectsUI.js**, **spaceship.js**,
**day-night-cycle.js**, **journal.js**, **population.js** and **warning.js**.
Ore scanning logic now lives directly inside **ScannerProject**.

# Effectable entities
Gameplay objects that can receive temporary or permanent modifiers extend
`EffectableEntity` in **effectable-entity.js**. Each keeps a list of active effects and
boolean flags. `addEffect`, `replaceEffect` and `removeEffect` apply or update these
effects so that buildings, resources, projects and life all share the same system.

# Resource flow
Resources are created via `createResources` and updated each tick by
`produceResources`:
1. Calculate theoretical production rates.
2. Recalculate storage capacities.
3. Update building productivity based on conditions.
4. Reset trackers and accumulate production/consumption.
5. Apply funding, terraforming and life effects.
6. Clamp values by caps.
7. Aggregate total rates for display.
Helper functions like `checkResourceAvailability` help modules plan without consuming
resources immediately.

## Nanotechnology
The `nanotechManager` oversees a self-replicating swarm unlocked by **Nanotechnology Stage I** research. The UI remains hidden until `enable()` is called.

- Swarm growth requires surplus power beyond storage; each bot draws 1e-11 W.
- Maximum nanobots equal planetary land area (m²) × 1e19, and only 1e15 bots survive travel.
- The growth slider adds up to +0.15 % growth. Stage I sliders modify growth while:
  - **Silicon Consumption** grants up to +0.15 % growth and consumes silicon from current storage plus accumulated changes.
  - **Maintenance I** reduces metal, glass, and water maintenance by up to 50 % but subtracts up to 0.15 % growth.
  - **Glass Production** yields glass at 1e-20 t/s per bot and also subtracts up to 0.15 % growth.
- Per-second energy, silicon, maintenance, and glass rates appear beside each slider with brief descriptions.
- Travel text notes that H.O.P.E. can hide 1e15 nanobots from the Dead Hand Protocol.

# UI refresh requirements
- **Starting a new game** – call `startNewGame()` which rebuilds game state.
- **Loading a save** – `loadGame()` invokes `initializeGameState({ skipStoryInitialization: true })` then applies the saved data.
- **Moving to another planet** – `selectPlanet(key)` switches the planet and
  calls `initializeGameState({ preserveManagers: true })` followed by `updateSpaceUI()`.
Failing to use these helpers may leave the DOM bound to outdated objects.
To ensure this works properly, every feature in the game that has an UI should have an enabled true/false attribute.  When updating its display, if the flag is true, the feature should be revealed.  If false, it should be hidden.  This flag should not be saved/loaded.  Instead, story unlocks, researches and other things will re enable it as needed.

# Testing
- Run `npm ci` to install dependencies before running tests.
- Save test output to a file so you don't have to rerun it just to read the results.
- Do not commit `test.log`; it is for local reference only and is ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Run tests **once** in non-watch mode with `CI=true npm test` and report how many passed or failed. Pipe the command to `tee` (e.g., `CI=true npm test 2>&1 | tee test.log`) so the results are both displayed and stored.
- Write tests for any new feature.
- Avoid asserting on exact story text; check IDs or prerequisites instead.

# Storytelling style
After Earth's destruction, prefix each character's dialogue with their name the
second time they speak in a chapter to help clarify who is talking.

# Character personalities
- **H.O.P.E.** – deadpan and literal AI, often classifying everything as a form of
  terraforming.
- **Martin** – whimsical and clever mentor figure.
- **Mary** – witty when times are good, serious when crisis strikes.
- **Adrien Solis** – sharp, opportunistic CEO with dark humor.
- **Dr. Evelyn Hart** – professional scientist behind Operation Sidestep.
- **Elias Kane** – charismatic cult leader secretly aiding the aliens.
- Atmospheric Water Collector unlocks via a hot, dry condition trigger treated as a
  prerequisite.
- Prerequisites can check conditions like objectives.
- Story events with chapter `-1` display in the current chapter without changing it.

## Warp Gate Command
Warp Gate Command provides a dedicated subtab for managing teams that embark on timed operations through the warp gate. Players recruit custom-named members with classes and skills, track their health, and choose operation difficulty. Operations grant experience and Alien artifacts, while R&D and Facilities menus offer equipment and training upgrades. Statistics and logs persist across planets so progress carries over between worlds.

## Space Mirror Facility
Space mirrors are overseen through sliders that distribute units across surface zones. Completing the Space Mirror Focusing research reveals an additional control that concentrates mirrors to melt surface ice into liquid water in the warmest zone with ice. The facility now handles zonal flux and melting calculations internally. The display now shows average and day temperature in each zone.
The temperature column header updates to match the current Celsius or Kelvin setting.
Oversight now includes a collapsible **Finer Controls** section for manual mirror and Hyperion Lantern assignments with adjustable step sizes and per‑zone auto‑assign checkboxes that funnel leftover units into the selected zones while locking sliders or buttons accordingly.
Unassigned mirrors or lanterns no longer affect luminosity, and lantern controls remain hidden until Hyperion Lanterns are unlocked.
calculateZoneSolarFluxWithFacility now respects the Unassigned slider so idle mirrors and lanterns contribute no flux.

## Random World Generator
The Random World Generator manager builds procedural planets and moons with lockable orbit and type options. Worlds must equilibrate before travel; a progress window tracks simulated time and allows canceling or ending early once the minimum fast-forward is reached. Seeds encode UI selections so players can revisit specific worlds, and the manager prevents travel to terraformed seeds while persisting star luminosity and other parameters through saves. Traveling from a fully terraformed world to a random world awards a skill point on the first visit, and planetary thrusters on these worlds use the host star's mass for orbital calculations.
