# Instructions
- Document major feature updates in this file.
- Keep imports and exports browser friendly for loading via **index.html**.
- The game needs to be able to run from a browser-like environment.
- Place story projects in **progress-data.js** near the chapter where they unlock.
- Tooltips should use a `<span class="info-tooltip-icon">&#9432;</span>` element with a descriptive `title`.

# Overview of code
This repository contains a browser-based incremental game written in JavaScript. The
entry point **index.html** loads scripts that create resources, buildings, colonies,
projects and research items from parameter files. Weather and surface modelling are
driven by modules like **terraforming.js**, **physics.js** and the various cycle files.
Economy and colony management rely on **resource.js**, **building.js**, **colony.js** and
UI modules. Story progression is handled by **StoryManager** in **progress.js** while
**SpaceManager** tracks the current planet.

# Additional gameplay systems
- **skills.js** and **skillsUI.js** implement the H.O.P.E. skill tree.
- **life.js** and **lifeUI.js** allow custom lifeform design.
- **space.js** and **spaceUI.js** manage interplanetary travel.
- **gold-asteroid.js** spawns a temporary bonus event.
- **autobuild.js** automatically constructs buildings when enabled.
- **milestones.js** and **milestonesUI.js** track long term goals.
- **solis.js** and **solisUI.js** provide a shop and quest system.
- The ResearchManager persists between planets so only advanced research remains after travel.

## Prestige systems
Two reset layers control long term progression:

### New game
Calling `startNewGame()` fully recreates the game state and returns the player to Mars. Nothing carries over between playthroughs.

### Planet travel
Selecting another world via `selectPlanet(key)` soft resets the colony while keeping meta systems. It awards one skill point on the first visit and calls `initializeGameState({ preserveManagers: true, preserveJournal: true })` so that:
* `ResearchManager` survives but `resetRegularResearch()` clears normal tech while advanced research and its resource are preserved.
* `SkillManager` retains unlocked skills and re‑applies their effects.
* `SolisManager` keeps quests, points and shop upgrades.
* `SpaceManager` records which planets have been visited or terraformed.
* `StoryManager` continues tracking active events and re‑applies their rewards.
* The **Dyson Swarm Receiver** project's collector count persists across planets, but the receiver must be rebuilt to regain energy production.

When loading a save or switching planets, call each manager's `reapplyEffects` method so stored modifiers affect the newly created game objects.

## Dyson Swarm Receiver
Research unlocks a large orbital array followed by the **Dyson Swarm Receiver** mega
project. The receiver costs 10&nbsp;M metal, 1&nbsp;M components and 100&nbsp;k electronics and
builds over five minutes. Once complete, players may deploy orbital solar collectors.
Collectors consume glass, electronics and components and can be automated. Their total
count persists between planets and each adds **Dyson Swarm** energy production.

Other modules include **save.js**, **projects.js**, **projectsUI.js**, **spaceship.js**,
**day-night-cycle.js**, **journal.js**, **population.js** and **warning.js**.
Ore scanning logic now lives directly inside **ScannerProject**.

# Effectable entities
Gameplay objects that can receive temporary or permanent modifiers extend
`EffectableEntity` in **effectable-entity.js**. Each keeps a list of active effects and
boolean flags. `addEffect`, `replaceEffect` and `removeEffect` apply or update these
effects so that buildings, resources, projects and life all share the same system.

# Resource flow
Resources are created via `createResources` and updated each tick by
`produceResources`:
1. Calculate theoretical production rates.
2. Recalculate storage capacities.
3. Update building productivity based on conditions.
4. Reset trackers and accumulate production/consumption.
5. Apply funding, terraforming and life effects.
6. Clamp values by caps.
7. Aggregate total rates for display.
Helper functions like `checkResourceAvailability` help modules plan without consuming
resources immediately.

# UI refresh requirements
- **Starting a new game** – call `startNewGame()` which rebuilds game state.
- **Loading a save** – `loadGame()` invokes `initializeGameState({ skipStoryInitialization: true })` then applies the saved data.
- **Moving to another planet** – `selectPlanet(key)` switches the planet and
  calls `initializeGameState({ preserveManagers: true })` followed by `updateSpaceUI()`.
Failing to use these helpers may leave the DOM bound to outdated objects.
To ensure this works properly, every feature in the game that has an UI should have an enabled true/false attribute.  When updating its display, if the flag is true, the feature should be revealed.  If false, it should be hidden.  This flag should not saved/loaded.  Instead, story unlocks, researches and other things will re enable it as needed.

# Testing
- `jest` and `jsdom` are available globally.
- Write tests for any new feature.
- Run tests with `npm test` and report how many passed or failed.
- Avoid asserting on exact story text; check IDs or prerequisites instead.

# Storytelling style
After Earth's destruction, prefix each character's dialogue with their name the
second time they speak in a chapter to help clarify who is talking.

# Character personalities
- **H.O.P.E.** – deadpan and literal AI, often classifying everything as a form of
  terraforming.
- **Martin** – whimsical and clever mentor figure.
- **Mary** – witty when times are good, serious when crisis strikes.
- **Adrien Solis** – sharp, opportunistic CEO with dark humor.
- **Dr. Evelyn Hart** – professional scientist behind Operation Sidestep.
- **Elias Kane** – charismatic cult leader secretly aiding the aliens.
- Atmospheric Water Collector unlocks via a hot, dry condition trigger treated as a
  prerequisite.
- Prerequisites can check conditions like objectives.
- Story events with chapter `-1` display in the current chapter without changing it.

- Random World Generator equilibration window now offers an End Early button after the minimum fast-forward, enabling travel with current planet parameters.
- Space UI caches the last world key and seed to skip redundant detail rendering.
- Auto mode in Random World Generator no longer generates locked planet types.
- Random World Generator now offers an Auto target option that randomly selects planets or moons.
- Random World Generator seeds now encode dropdown selections and override menu choices when used.
- Fixed Gas Giant parent bodies showing a NaN radius in the Random World Generator.
- Habitable zone orbit presets in the Random World Generator now vary distance to provide differing solar flux.
- Hot and cold orbit presets in the Random World Generator now ensure solar flux above 1.5 kW/m² and below 500 W/m² respectively with randomized variability.
- Hot orbit option in the Random World Generator is now locked, and Auto selects a random unlocked orbit preset.
- Random World Generator UI now respects the global Celsius setting for temperature displays.
- Random World Generator is now handled by a manager extending EffectableEntity and tracks locked options internally.
- Solar flux now accounts for the generating star's luminosity when visiting random worlds.
- Random World Generator UI now reflects manager-locked orbit and type options during regular UI updates.
- Random World Generator dropdowns now only change when their lock state changes, preventing flicker.
- Random World Generator now precomputes zonal coverages and derives temperatures using physics.js.
- Random World Generator UI now reads day/night/mean temperatures directly from the physics model instead of estimating them separately.
- Solar luminosity for Random World Generator worlds now persists through saves and reloads.
- Random World Generator equilibration window now displays refinement counts and simulated time.
- Innovation Initiative now boosts android research output.
- Alien artifact resource values now persist across planet travel, mirroring advanced research.
- Resource tooltip time line now reserves space with a blank line when no time to full or empty is shown, preventing flicker.
- Focused mirror melting now grants liquid water freeze immunity, fully protecting 50× the melted amount and partially shielding another 50× based on freezing intensity.
- Radiation penalty values below 0.01% are hidden from the UI.
- Radiation display in the terraforming UI now shows mSv/day without formatNumber and values below 0.01 mSv/day appear as 0.
- Added an Average resource changes setting that displays surface and atmospheric resource rates averaged over the last second.
