# Instructions
- Document major feature updates in this file.
- Keep imports and exports browser friendly for loading via **index.html**.
- The game needs to be able to run from a browser-like environment.
- Place story projects in **progress-data.js** near the chapter where they unlock.
- Tooltips should use a `<span class="info-tooltip-icon">&#9432;</span>` element with a descriptive `title`.

# Overview of code
This repository contains a browser-based incremental game written in JavaScript. The
entry point **index.html** loads scripts that create resources, buildings, colonies,
projects and research items from parameter files. Weather and surface modelling are
driven by modules like **terraforming.js**, **physics.js** and the various cycle files.
Economy and colony management rely on **resource.js**, **building.js**, **colony.js** and
UI modules. Story progression is handled by **StoryManager** in **progress.js** while
**SpaceManager** tracks the current planet.

# Additional gameplay systems
- **skills.js** and **skillsUI.js** implement the H.O.P.E. skill tree.
- **life.js** and **lifeUI.js** allow custom lifeform design.
- **space.js** and **spaceUI.js** manage interplanetary travel.
- **gold-asteroid.js** spawns a temporary bonus event.
- **autobuild.js** automatically constructs buildings when enabled.
- **milestones.js** and **milestonesUI.js** track long term goals.
- **solis.js** and **solisUI.js** provide a shop and quest system.
- The ResearchManager persists between planets so only advanced research remains after travel.

## Prestige systems
Two reset layers control long term progression:

### New game
Calling `startNewGame()` fully recreates the game state and returns the player to Mars. Nothing carries over between playthroughs.

### Planet travel
Selecting another world via `selectPlanet(key)` soft resets the colony while keeping meta systems. It awards one skill point on the first visit and calls `initializeGameState({ preserveManagers: true, preserveJournal: true })` so that:
* `ResearchManager` survives but `resetRegularResearch()` clears normal tech while advanced research and its resource are preserved.
* `SkillManager` retains unlocked skills and re‑applies their effects.
* `SolisManager` keeps quests, points and shop upgrades.
* `SpaceManager` records which planets have been visited or terraformed.
* `StoryManager` continues tracking active events and re‑applies their rewards.
* The **Dyson Swarm Receiver** project's collector count persists, maintaining its energy contribution across planets.

When loading a save or switching planets, call each manager's `reapplyEffects` method so stored modifiers affect the newly created game objects.

## Dyson Swarm Receiver
Research unlocks a large orbital array followed by the **Dyson Swarm Receiver** mega
project. The receiver costs 10&nbsp;M metal, 1&nbsp;M components and 100&nbsp;k electronics and
builds over five minutes. Once complete, players may deploy orbital solar collectors.
Collectors consume glass, electronics and components and can be automated. Their total
count persists between planets and each adds **Dyson Swarm** energy production.

Other modules include **save.js**, **projects.js**, **projectsUI.js**, **spaceship.js**,
**day-night-cycle.js**, **journal.js**, **population.js** and **warning.js**.
Ore scanning logic now lives directly inside **ScannerProject**.

# Effectable entities
Gameplay objects that can receive temporary or permanent modifiers extend
`EffectableEntity` in **effectable-entity.js**. Each keeps a list of active effects and
boolean flags. `addEffect`, `replaceEffect` and `removeEffect` apply or update these
effects so that buildings, resources, projects and life all share the same system.

# Resource flow
Resources are created via `createResources` and updated each tick by
`produceResources`:
1. Calculate theoretical production rates.
2. Recalculate storage capacities.
3. Update building productivity based on conditions.
4. Reset trackers and accumulate production/consumption.
5. Apply funding, terraforming and life effects.
6. Clamp values by caps.
7. Aggregate total rates for display.
Helper functions like `checkResourceAvailability` help modules plan without consuming
resources immediately.

# UI refresh requirements
- **Starting a new game** – call `startNewGame()` which rebuilds game state.
- **Loading a save** – `loadGame()` invokes `initializeGameState({ skipStoryInitialization: true })` then applies the saved data.
- **Moving to another planet** – `selectPlanet(key)` switches the planet and
  calls `initializeGameState({ preserveManagers: true })` followed by `updateSpaceUI()`.
Failing to use these helpers may leave the DOM bound to outdated objects.
To ensure this works properly, every feature in the game that has an UI should have an enabled true/false attribute.  When updating its display, if the flag is true, the feature should be revealed.  If false, it should be hidden.  This flag should not saved/loaded.  Instead, story unlocks, researches and other things will re enable it as needed.

# Testing
- `jest` and `jsdom` are available globally.
- Write tests for any new feature.
- Run tests with `npm test` and report how many passed or failed.
- Avoid asserting on exact story text; check IDs or prerequisites instead.

# Storytelling style
After Earth's destruction, prefix each character's dialogue with their name the
second time they speak in a chapter to help clarify who is talking.

# Character personalities
- **H.O.P.E.** – deadpan and literal AI, often classifying everything as a form of
  terraforming.
- **Martin** – whimsical and clever mentor figure.
- **Mary** – witty when times are good, serious when crisis strikes.
- **Adrien Solis** – sharp, opportunistic CEO with dark humor.
- **Dr. Evelyn Hart** – professional scientist behind Operation Sidestep.
- **Elias Kane** – charismatic cult leader secretly aiding the aliens.
- Atmospheric Water Collector unlocks via a hot, dry condition trigger treated as a
  prerequisite.
- Prerequisites can check conditions like objectives.
- Story events with chapter `-1` display in the current chapter without changing it.

- Android assignment speed tooltip now states "1 + sqrt(androids assigned / ore mines built)".
- Deeper mining projects track maximum depth instead of repeat count and display average depth in the UI.

- Planetary Thrusters now use continuous power with internal element references and save/load their investment state.
- Planetary Thrusters UI now calculates delta-v and energy using the entered targets and hides spiral Δv until moons escape.
- Spin, motion and thruster power cards stay hidden until the project is completed.
- Thruster power display now uses `formatNumber` and energy consumption registers in resource rates.

- WGC layout is generated dynamically via wgcUI.js instead of hardcoded in index.html.
- WGC R&D menu lets players spend Alien artifacts on team equipment and factory efficiency upgrades.
- Quantity selector buttons display their effect: "+" and "-" show the current step (e.g. +1, -1, +10, -10). The x10 and /10 buttons multiply or divide the step, never dropping below 1, and the 0 button resets the count.
- Ore satellite build quantity now caps at the project's maximum repeat count.

  10HP damage per level to the chosen member while failed team checks damage all
  members for 10HP.
