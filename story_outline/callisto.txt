Callisto Story Timeline (Narrative‑Scale, No Explicit Dates)

Mars and Titan remain allies throughout, each installing their own Sidestepping Sub‑Engines. By the end of this arc all three worlds—Mars, Titan, and Callisto—are fully terraformed. The entire sequence spans years, but the player never sees a calendar.

Introduction

Touchdown on Callisto: H.O.P.E. establishes the primary base on an ice‑free equatorial plateau. Mary (Mars) and President Bob (Titan) pledge logistical support.

Top‑Secret Science Briefing: Dr. Evelyn Hart meets over a one‑time, quantum‑scrambled channel with a need‑to‑know list shorter than ten names. She explains:

Unearth the abandoned Planetary Thruster Project—originally a climate‑engineering experiment meant to nudge Earth farther from the Sun.

Finish and repurpose it (code‑named Sidestepping Engine).

Build scaled, hidden copies on Mars and Titan.

Run Operation Sidestep: a months‑long random‑walk of micro‑burns—“like a Fremen sand‑walk across Arrakis”—to scramble enemy targeting algorithms.

Absolute secrecy: even routine comms are layered with innocuous cover projects; open chatter refers only to "Heat‑Sink Upgrades." Any leak could doom the plan.

Early Events

Rediscovery & Covert Excavation: Surveys locate buried reactor pylons; Mars forwards digitised blueprints in sliced packets disguised as botanical genomes; Titan ships cryogenic drills labelled "hydrology gear."

Cult Emergence: Elias Kane founds the Cult of Three Wounds, preaching that resistance defies destiny—and demands total information transparency. Their first goal: expose the "Heat‑Sink" deception.

Rising Action

Alien Prisoner Escape: Kane frees the captured alien, turning it into a living beacon for his cause and sparking panic.

Sabotage & Repairs: Cultists cripple life‑support and dig equipment; inter‑colony convoys rush covert replacements.

Co‑ordinated Fabrication: Mars forges Sub‑Engine cores in a sealed bunker; Titan casts super‑alloy girders during scheduled reactor‑maintenance blackouts; Callisto clears the main engine vault under electromagnetic jamming blankets.

Turning Points

Deep‑Ice Expedition: Mary, Dr. Hart, and security retrieve critical control modules through a warren of shielded tunnels; the alien is subdued again.

Public Cover vs. Secret Reality: Colonial news networks celebrate "New Oceanic Terraforming Reactors" while engineers quietly bolt Sidestepping Engine housings together.

Kane’s Broadcast: Hijacked comms spread prophecies of annihilation, stoking unrest. Crucially, he hasn’t uncovered the real project—but vows to find "whatever H.O.P.E. is hiding beneath the waves."

Climax

Cult Countdown: An intercepted cult transmission reveals an alien strike will occur within one orbital season. Operation Sidestep must launch a month earlier, so construction moves to round‑the‑clock secrecy.

Callisto Main Engine: Final assembly amid drone‑driven sabotage; work crews rotate through sealed compartments to limit knowledge overlap.

Mars & Titan Engines: Buried sub‑units reach readiness beneath layers of mis‑registered mining records.

Cult’s Last Assault: Kane’s drones attack during Callisto’s coolant‑purge test. Security repels them; Kane is captured—his lieutenants vanish with stolen data cores.

Sidestep Operation

Random‑Walk Burns: For many weeks, the three engines fire tiny, pseudo‑random bursts generated seconds before ignition. Even internal logs show only hashed vectors.

Alien Strike: Beams and asteroid converge on predicted coordinates—empty space. Cult channels erupt in confused jubilation when the predicted destruction fails to materialize; no alien transmissions are detected, leaving only speculation about their reaction.

Aftermath — Three Worlds Renewed

Triple‑Planet Celebration: Mars’ once‑dusty valleys bloom, Titan’s hazy orange skies clear to reveal sapphire methane‑seas turned temperate water, and Callisto becomes a shallow ocean world dotted with floating archipelagos. Humanity cheers—but only a handful understand why the enemy missed.

Cult Persistence: Though Kane is imprisoned, lieutenants establish semi‑submerged monasteries and algae farms among Callisto’s drifting atolls, seed clandestine enclaves in Titan’s cloud forests, and whisper in Martian megacities. The Cult is far from broken.

Hook for the Next Chapter — On to Ganymede

Cult Homeworld Rumour: Interrogations reveal the Cult’s high council—the "Triune Seat"—operates from a hidden fortress beneath Ganymede’s ancient grooved terrain. Their stolen data cores may have cracked part of Operation Sidestep’s secrecy.

Mission Green‑Light: Mary proposes a pre‑emptive strike: “If the Cult masters our own trick, the next alien volley won’t miss.” The colonies vote. H.O.P.E. must lead an expedition to Ganymede to dismantle the Cult at its source and safeguard Sidestep secrets.
