Stage 1: Arrival—The Ghost City

Explorers arrive at a towering ecumenopolis, expecting life but met only by silence.

The city is structurally perfect but eerily abandoned. Streets are littered with vehicles, personal items, and hastily erected barricades.

Buildings show signs of desperate efforts to contain something, yet there are no remains, bodies, or even bones—only dust and emptiness.

Discovery:

Immediate Clue: Emergency barricades activated, quarantine zones clearly marked. Something terrifying happened here, but there are no physical remains, intensifying mystery.

Stage 2: Shattered Hope—Traces of Chaos

Explorers enter residential areas, markets, and community centers showing signs of panic: broken windows, overturned furniture, desperate messages scrawled on walls.

Security recordings show terrified people barricading themselves inside buildings or fleeing from unseen threats, but the footage strangely cuts off abruptly as people fall, convulsing, out of frame.

Dust-like husks scattered across sealed quarantine chambers hint at mass deaths or disappearances.

Discovery:

Disturbing Recordings: Fragmented surveillance footage reveals citizens succumbing to something internal, collapsing in agony as if devoured from within.

Stage 3: The Laboratories—Desperation and Horror

Explorers uncover medical facilities and laboratories, clearly overwhelmed by crisis. Researchers’ notes describe rapid physical deterioration and panic-driven emergency measures.

Logs describe symptoms: fatigue, mental collapse, rapid physical decay, and the terrifying inability to isolate or treat the "infection."

Samples of unknown organic matter, now inert, lie scattered across examination rooms, labeled as biohazards.

Discovery:

Medical Logs: Detailed panic-driven documentation of a parasitic organism overtaking hosts from the inside, draining their life force rapidly, leaving behind brittle husks that crumble into dust.

Stage 4: Truth Emerges—The Gift’s True Nature

In deeper, heavily secured archives, explorers find hidden reports describing an alien encounter initially celebrated as first contact.

The aliens brought a symbiotic organism promised to enhance the health, intelligence, and lifespans of the population—a gift that soon revealed its parasitic nature.

Horrified scientists discovered too late that the organism, once integrated, rapidly drained all life from its host. By then, most of the population was already infected.

Discovery:

Hidden Message: An official confession from authorities acknowledging that the alien gift was a weaponized trap. Their civilization was betrayed and doomed by their own naive optimism.

Stage 5: Final Revelation—The Aliens’ Dark Purpose

Characters uncover a deliberately left alien message beacon, transmitting calmly to the stars: “Witness our strength. Our weapon is elegant, perfect. Your world may be next.”

It's clear now that the atrocity was a calculated demonstration to intimidate other species and civilizations—a warning wrapped in a false promise of advancement.

Discovery:

Sinister Beacon Recording: A cold, calculated alien message inviting future civilizations to surrender willingly, knowing the consequences of defiance.

Stage 6: Lingering Danger and Escape

In the moment of realization, explorers accidentally reactivate dormant parasite spores due to their presence, causing isolated samples to reanimate aggressively.

They must race against time to escape the city while activating ancient containment protocols, sacrificing portions of the city to stop the parasite's reawakening.

The explorers must now carry this terrible knowledge home: how the ecumenopolis fell, and the truth about the alien threat that awaits the wider universe.

Discovery:

Last Transmission: An urgent, tragic plea from an inhabitant asking whoever finds the message to warn others, never to trust the “gifts” of strangers from the stars again.
